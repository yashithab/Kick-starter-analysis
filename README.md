# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise wants to discover how other campaigns fared in relation to thier launch dates and funding goals. 
The purpose of the first deliverable is to discover and visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month. The second deliverable showcases the relationship 
between the goal-amount ranges and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based off of the graph from "https://github.com/yashithab/Kick-starter-analysis_challenge/blob/master/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png"
it can be noticed that there have been more successful outcomes in the warmer months (Apr-Jun). It can also
be noted that more plays are hosted during the warmer months of the year. In the other months the number of
plays hosted decreases.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Outcomes are inversely proportionate to to its goals as it can be seen in the graph "https://github.com/yashithab/Kick-starter-analysis_challenge/blob/master/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png"
The higher the goal amount, the lower the success rate for the outcome. The lower the goal amount, the higher the success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some difficulties that were faced was to organize the data in a user friendly manner. This was overcomed 
by creating a pivot table to structure the data in a proper organization for better understanding of the data. 
I then used the pivot table to create a visual to discover any patterns or trends in the data.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
In conclusion, the success rate for plays is higher during the months from April to June, and there are lower failures. 
During the colder months, the number of plays launced is significantly lower and displaying lower failed plays.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It can be concluded the percentage successful is inversely proportionate to the percentage failed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations to the data set include: the accuracy of the information, data varies based of seasonality,
there are outliers within the data which can hinder the analysis of the data. These are some limitations for the data.
